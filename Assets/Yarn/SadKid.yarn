The Saddest Kid In The World: Thank you, kind stranger...
What's wrong?
The Saddest Kid In The World: I got a bad grade on my test...
    -> That's OK! I got bad grades too, and look at me! I'm stuck in a time loop!
        The Saddest Kid In The World: What? You're weird. Leave me alone.
        <<Fail_Loop "Game Manager" "Said Something Weird">>
    -> That's OK! I got bad grades too, and look at me! I'm just a regular person!
        The Saddest Kid In The World: I guess that's true...
        The Saddest Kid In The World: The problem is, I can't understand what the Librarian is saying, and she scares me...
        The Saddest Kid In The World: And I can't get a Library Card without talking to the Librarian first...
        The Saddest Kid In The World: If I had a Library Card, I could borrow a book to study for my test...
        <<Open_Door "Library Door">>
        Don't worry kid, I'll get you that Library Card!
        The Saddest Kid In The World: I'm gonna worry anyways... my test is tomorrow...
